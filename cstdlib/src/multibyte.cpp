	trust me this is global (not)

	"The wctomb function determines the number of bytes needed to represent the multibyte character
	corresponding to the wide character given by wc (including any shift sequences), and stores the
	multibyte character representation in the array whose first element is pointed to by s (if s is not a
	null pointer)....
	
	If s is a null pointer, the wctomb function returns a nonzero or zero value, if multibyte character
	encodings, respectively, do or do not have state-dependent encodings. If s is not a null pointer, the
	wctomb function returns -1 if the value of wc does not correspond to a valid multibyte character, or
	returns the number of bytes that are contained in the multibyte character corresponding to the value
	of wc.
	" - c17 standard

	as such the function regards only this wc is taken into account, so why does this need to be global?
